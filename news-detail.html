                              <h3>Employee Wellbeing and Physical Workout</h3>
<blockquote></blockquote>
                              Creating the best employee wellbeing should be a priority for every employer. In this article, we’ll explore why maintaining optimal wellbeing is crucial for both employers and employees.  

You’ll also discover practical ways to improve your employees' wellbeing immediately, and why it will become even more important in the future.  

As you’ll learn, prioritizing employee wellbeing has a positive impact on business outcomes. Find out how recognizing and supporting your employees can drive your company’s success.  
<blockquote>What is Employee Wellbeing</blockquote> 

<p>In the past, employers primarily focused on health benefits when addressing employee wellbeing. However, we now understand that wellbeing goes beyond simply the absence of illness among employees.  

Employee wellbeing involves optimizing the overall health of all employees, encompassing physical, mental, and other key aspects that contribute to a well-functioning individual.  

In other words, the concept of employee wellbeing has evolved from its traditional focus on providing medical care. Today, employers recognize the various elements that make up employee wellbeing and are working to create a happier, healthier workforce.</p>

<blockquote>Why Employee Wellbeing Is More Important Than Ever Before</blockquote> 

<p>With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, many employers have seen firsthand the impact employee wellbeing has on performance, and ultimately, on business results. Employees experienced heightened stress and worry, prompting employers to find new ways to address these growing needs with greater empathy.</p> 
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/well2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>  
<p>Specifically, psychologists have warned that quarantine can trigger an increase in mental health issues such as depression or even PTSD. As a result, many employers began carefully preparing their plans for returning to work after COVID-19.  

However, employee wellbeing was gaining significant attention long before the pandemic. Now, more than ever, it’s clear why prioritizing employee wellbeing is essential.</p>
<blockquote>1. Reduced absenteeism and healthcare costs</blockquote>

<p>Companies have started to recognize that preventing issues related to poor employee wellbeing—such as burnout, stress, and sickness—is far more cost-effective than reacting once these problems have already occurred.  

Specifically, a sedentary lifestyle among employees increases the risk of conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases. Additionally, employees who frequently experience burnout are 63% more likely to take sick days, directly impacting absenteeism and the associated costs for employers.  

In response, many companies have begun implementing wellness programs. These programs vary in scope and focus, but they have proven to be a cost-effective solution for improving employee wellbeing.  

For instance, Johnson & Johnson reported saving $250 million on healthcare costs over the past decade thanks to their wellness initiatives, with a return on investment (ROI) of $2.71 for every dollar spent on employee wellbeing.</p> 
<blockquote>2. Increased employee engagement</blockquote> 

<p>Research shows that 85% of companies believe wellness programs support employee engagement. When these programs are implemented, employees feel more connected, experience improved health, and consequently, greater happiness.  

All of these factors play a key role in boosting employee engagement. However, it’s important to recognize that employee engagement is also shaped by practices like effective feedback and meaningful recognition. To truly enhance engagement in your company, take a holistic approach.</p> 

<blockquote>3. Improved employee productivity</blockquote> 
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/well1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 
<p>Research shows that smokers are twice as likely to take time off work, while employees with obesity tend to take three to six more sick days annually compared to those of normal weight. On the other hand, employees who manage stress effectively are less likely to experience burnout.  

Overall, when employee wellbeing is optimized, employees become more focused on their work, leading to increased productivity.</p>

<blockquote>4. Improved employee morale</blockquote> 

<p>Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, it became clear how crucial it is to maintain employee morale. By implementing initiatives like mental health workshops or fitness competitions between departments or teams, you can significantly boost your employees' morale.</p> 
<blockquote>5. Attractive employer branding</blockquote>  

<p>Seventy-eight percent of employers offer wellness programs to attract and retain top talent. In today’s competitive job market, high-quality candidates have multiple options when choosing their next employer. Providing wellbeing benefits that align with the needs of your future workforce is essential to attracting the best candidates, ensuring your company’s long-term success.</p>

<blockquote>What Impacts Employee Wellbeing</blockquote>

<p>As we’ve discussed, employee wellbeing encompasses various aspects of care for your team. By optimizing wellbeing, you’ll positively impact your employees' overall experience. Creating meaningful work and reducing stress helps foster a comfortable working environment where your employees can truly thrive.</p>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/well8.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 
Look at what impacts employee wellbeing.

<blockquote>1. Recognizing your employees' work</blockquote> 

<p>When your employees’ hard work, dedication, and teamwork are genuinely appreciated, they feel more fulfilled and satisfied in their roles. Furthermore, recognition boosts productivity and fosters a culture of appreciation. Ultimately, recognizing your employees’ efforts inspires them and reinforces their vital role within your company.</p>  

<blockquote>2. Facilitating seamless communication</blockquote> 

<p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, work disruption has reached new heights. While remote work continues to be a part of the landscape, it’s now in a more manageable form than during the peak crisis period. In many companies, employee wellbeing was challenged during this time, but it was mitigated by clear and timely communication.  

To ensure smooth internal communication, make sure your employees read the information intended for them. Additionally, remote employees often struggle with communication and collaboration. By facilitating seamless communication between team members, you can reduce one of the main sources of stress in a remote work environment.</p>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/well7.jpeg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 
<blockquote>3. Enabling easy collaboration</blockquote>

<p>Collaborating in large teams can be a source of stress for many employees, especially when tracking each other's progress or assessing individual contributions becomes difficult. While teamwork is an inevitable part of the work process, enabling seamless collaboration can significantly improve employee wellbeing and reduce stress levels.</p> 

<blockquote>4. Listening to your employees</blockquote> 

<p>Your employees want to be heard! When grievances go unaddressed, they may feel their opinions don’t matter. Listening to your employees and acting on their feedback makes them feel valued, creating a sense of belonging and meaning in their work, which in turn boosts employee wellbeing.  

That’s why regular employee pulse checks are crucial. Conducting these surveys helps you understand your team’s needs and gather valuable insights. Below is a sample of questions every employee should be asked.</p> 
<blockquote>5. Giving regular and timely feedback</blockquote> 

<p>Receiving regular feedback makes 68% of employees more satisfied with their jobs. Continuous feedback helps employees feel their growth is valued, allowing them to understand how to improve their performance, advance their skills, and continue learning. This sense of satisfaction and happiness in their careers is essential for enhancing overall employee wellbeing.</p> 

<blockquote>6. Showing empathy</blockquote>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/well4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 

<p>There are no strict instructions on how to show empathy in the workplace, but the growing need to create more human-centered environments is clear. The shift towards workplaces that prioritize their employees and foster a sense of community—rather than merely treating them as workers or customers—is already underway.  

Showing empathy and compassion for your employees’ concerns builds an emotional connection, humanizes the workplace, and creates a more supportive and positive environment for everyone.</p> 
<blockquote>What Companies Can Do to Improve Their Employees' Wellbeing</blockquote>

<p>A company can adopt various strategies to enhance employee wellbeing. The key is first understanding the many benefits that employee wellbeing brings, then designing programs that specifically target the areas you wish to improve within your organization.

Take a look at our ideas for improving your employees' wellbeing.</p> 
<blockquote>1. Health screening</blockquote> 

<p>Offering health screenings once a year allows your employees to identify potential health issues early, significantly increasing the chances of disease prevention. Regular check-ups within a short timeframe can encourage employees to visit the doctor, ensuring they take better care of their health.</p>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/news-image3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 

<blockquote>2. Health insurance</blockquote> 

<p>Providing multiple health insurance options allows employees to choose the plan that best suits their specific needs, ensuring they have coverage that aligns with their individual circumstances.</p> 
<blockquote>3. Gym membership</blockquote> 

<p>Offering gym memberships is an excellent employee wellbeing benefit. It makes your company more attractive to potential hires while helping employees stay in shape and reduce stress. Regular exercise is also a key component in maintaining overall health and wellbeing.</p> 
<blockquote>4. Employee wellbeing solution</blockquote> 

<p>Implementing health initiatives, such as company-wide running or cycling competitions, is a fantastic way to encourage physical activity, boost competitiveness, and foster team spirit among employees. Explore the modules available in our employee wellbeing solution, *Healthain*, to discover how you can enhance your employees' wellbeing and reap the benefits of a healthier, more engaged workforce.</p> 
<blockquote>5. Providing healthy meals</blockquote>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/well9.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 

<p>Many employees' poor health stems from their diet. Since preparing meals takes a lot of time, many employees opt for fast food for lunch. If you start providing healthier meals in your cafeteria or negotiate discounts for restaurants with healthy food options, you will help your employees stay healthy and more focused in the workplace.</p> 
<blockquote>6. Mental wellbeing apps</blockquote>

<p>There are several mindfulness and meditation apps you can look into and propose for your employees to use if you detect they could use it. Help your employees discover such apps and let them know how beneficial meditation and mindfulness can be in their daily lives and coping with stress.</p> 
<blockquote>7. Psychological counseling services</blockquote> 
<p>
By offering psychological counseling services, you will also send a message to your employees that their mental health is your concern, too. The stigma of asking for psychological help will be reduced, and your employees will have access to mental health experts that can help them deal with their issues.</p>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/well11.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 
<blockquote>8. Flexible work options</blockquote> 
<p>
When you offer flexible working hours or remote work options, you are increasing work-life balance for your employees. According to research, only 8% of employees believe work-life balance is less important than compensation. Besides, knowing that remote work is increasingly popular, this is one of the easiest and most desired employee wellbeing benefits your company could offer. </p>

<blockquote>9. Financial benefits</blockquote> 
<p>
Many employees are nowadays asking for life insurance, pension or student loan repayment options. Helping your employees make wise financial decisions for their future can help you become a more attractive employer, too. </p>
<blockquote>10. Employee wellbeing initiatives according to your employees</blockquote> 
<p>
Every company is different, so maybe you can start by surveying your employees about employee wellbeing initiatives they would find most useful. Also, you can inspect your employees' state of mind when it comes to sources of stress in the workplace.</p>  

<blockquote>The Future of Employee Wellbeing</blockquote>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/well12.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 
<p>
Employee wellbeing is important more than ever because companies finally realized the power it has to transform their employees' lives, reduce costs related to absenteeism and healthcare, and create a healthy company culture. The COVID-19 outbreak has surely put more emphasis on mental wellbeing than ever before, which will lead to more understanding and empathy in the period to come. 

Employers have been focusing less on particular health conditions and more on benefits such as fitness activities and standing desks. After all, preventing development of diseases is much cheaper than curing them, and it benefits the employees as well.  

In the future, we will see more diversified employee wellbeing benefits. The costs of employee disengagement, absenteeism and healthcare are too high to be ignored. Therefore, employers will gradually realize the potential in employee wellbeing and start taking care of their employees' mental, physical and financial wellbeing.</p>

<blockquote>How to Evaluate Your Employees' Wellbeing</blockquote> 
<p>
In order to optimize your employees' wellbeing, you need to know what you are starting with. Moreover, you have to track the changes in results as you implement employee wellbeing initiatives. 

Here is a list of questions we propose you ask your employees if you want to see the state of your employee wellbeing. Feel free to use them in a survey or adapt them according to your company's standards.

<blockquote>Employee Wellbeing Categories</blockquote>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/about-bg11.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div> 
<p>
Employee wellbeing can be put into multiple categories. These types of wellbeing can help employers determine various kinds of benefits they offer to employees. By including more different kinds of benefits, they will approach employee wellbeing more holistically and optimize the health of all their employees. </p>

<blockquote>Read what kinds of employee wellbeing are there.</blockquote> 
<blockquote>1. Financial wellbeing</blockquote> 
<p>
One of the most neglected aspects of employee wellbeing is financial wellbeing. Your employees' sense of security and their feeling of having enough money to meet their needs affects their wellbeing, therefore their everyday job performance. 

This was best seen in April 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, during which 54% of employees were mostly worried about their job security. The possibility of losing financial means severely impacted employee wellbeing, thus affecting overall focus and productivity. 

Moreover, employees are looking to find adequate pension benefits or student loan repayment benefits when considering a job. That is why employers provide services that help their employees make important financial decisions.</p>  
<blockquote>2. Mental wellbeing</blockquote> 
<p>
Nowadays, stress is an overwhelmingly present factor in all our lives. A lot of it can come from the workplace, but even if it does not, it still affects your employees' performance. According to research, 84% of direct effects on productivity loss and 93% of indirect influences can be attributed to mental and physical health. 

Mental wellbeing as a part of employee wellbeing takes into consideration stress, burnout or any other feeling of unease in employees. Mental health benefits or a company culture in which mental health is openly discussed can equip your employees with means to take care of their psychological soundness. In turn, employees will take less sick days and overall perform better on the job.</p> 
<blockquote>3. Physical wellbeing</blockquote>
<p>
As a most traditional part of employee wellbeing, physical wellbeing encompasses prevention or curing physical illnesses. For example, many companies offer fitness incentives or gym memberships to its employees in order to promote healthy lifestyle and prevent development of multiple illnesses. 

Furthermore, taking care of physical wellbeing of employees also means providing benefits that will help employees control their ongoing chronic diseases. That is why 31% of organizations offered onsite health screening programs in 2019. </p>

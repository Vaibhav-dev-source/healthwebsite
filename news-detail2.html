                              <h3>Introducing a new healing process</h3>

We asked readers to select up to three out of 25 topics covered in the Best Practices feature. The top 10 vote-getters include using scribes to aid physicians, payers publishing the cost of services and ways to smooth the discharge process.
<blockquote>Top 10 Best Practices chosen by Modern Healthcare readers</blockquote>
                              <p><li>Using collaboration to cut readmission rates: Hospitals that have forged collaborations among providers and community-based organizations and that encourage self-management have rapidly reduced readmissions.</li>

<li>Adopting telehealth to boost patient outcomes: Platforms that engage patients before and after surgery produce better results than traditional approaches.</li>

<li>Thwarting the spread of deadly bacteria: To stop the spread of hard-to-treat infections, hospitals are sending weekly emails to hospital leaders that include an update on the number of cases and a ranking of unit performance as well as an action plan.</li>

<li>Hiring medical scribes to allow physicians to focus on patients: Providers' use of medical scribes has been shown to reduce wait times for patients and encourage more patient-centered care.</li>

<li>Using software to avoid misdiagnoses: Computer-assisted diagnosis technology is underutilized, but studies suggest it can help by boosting physicians' diagnostic confidence, reducing costs and improving patient outcomes.</li>

<li>Payers publishing what services cost: To increase transparency, insurers are creating searchable databases that allow the general public to see how much it pays particular providers for services.</li>

<li>Making the discharge process smoother: Hospitals are implementing processes—including starting discharge planning on the date of admission and using checklists—to reduce bottlenecks and ease patient flow.</li>

<li>Targeting the right patients for support: The Patient Activation Measure, developed by a team at the University of Oregon and introduced in 2004, helps health systems predict which patients are best equipped to engage in their care and which ones will be overwhelmed and in need of additional support.</li>

<li>Leadership development for future administrators: Hospitals are creating formal programs to identify and retain promising leaders and to give them the skills to move up within the organization.</li>

<li>Residency programs for nurses: Nursing residency-type programs can help meet demand for trained nurses while cutting costs for hospitals.</li>

                              <blockquote>Modern healthcare today</blockquote>
                              <p>Modern healthcare has been transformed by advances in technology. The rise of a consumerization culture where people can easily shop around for suitable services also has an impact on modern healthcare. Medical practice managers need to respond to these changes by developing strategies to provide the best patient care while remaining profitable. For decades, technology has been used in medicine to operate specialist machinery, like MRI scanners and x-ray machines. Here are common features of modern healthcare and how your practice can implement strategies to rise to the challenges and seize opportunities:</p>
                              
                              <ul>
                                   <li>Improved doctor-patient communication</li>
                                   <li>Efficient recording of information in real-time</li>
                                   <li>More collaboration</li>
<li>Better connectivity with Internet of Things (IoT)</li>
<li>The rise of wearable tracking devices</li>
                              </ul>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/amazing tech2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>

                              <blockquote>Improved doctor-patient communication</blockquote>
<p>Improving patient satisfaction scores should be a top priority for medical practices. The drive towards patient-centered care is a key facet of modern healthcare and doctors need to find new ways of effectively communicating with their patients. Patient engagement should extend beyond the conventional office visits. Health practitioners can learn from other industries, like retail, and consider using apps like chatbots to communicate with patients about run-of-the-mill inquiries. These chatbots can be developed and monitored by healthcare professionals. Facilitating this type of communication can be in the form of an online triage system to point patients in the right direction.
<blockquote>Efficient recording of information in real-time</blockquote>
Modern healthcare is driven by data. However, this data will only be fit for purpose if it's accurate and delivered on time. Errors when recording symptoms have led to misdiagnosis and the wrong treatment being administered. The traditional way of recording information involved doctors writing information on paper charts. These charts would need to be circulated to the different doctors dealing with the patient's care. Moving paper around increased the likelihood that charts would be misplaced. For example, charts could be lost if a patient changed doctors or went to see a different doctor, such as a locum. Paper charts depended on the patients being able to remember details of their diagnosis and treatment to ensure that their records were up to date.
<blockquote>Better connectivity with Internet of Things (IoT)</blockquote>
The IoT is when physical devices (known as connected or 'smart' devices) are embedded with software, sensors, and electronics to collect and exchange data. With the IoT healthcare market forecast to reach $136.8 billion globally be 2021, the IoT is becoming an increasing fixture in modern healthcare. The growth of the IoT is attributed to the following:
    <li>An increase in the number of wearable devices.</li>

    <li>Higher rates of chronic diseases.</li>

    <li>Better access to high-speed internet.</li>

    <li>Expectations of cheaper treatment and disease management.</li>
<img src="images/healing2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
There are many applications of the IoT in modern healthcare. Remote monitoring and medical device integration are two such uses. The aim of utilizing the IoT in modern healthcare is to increase patient engagement and improve the ways that doctors deliver care. Healthcare providers, like Stanley Healthcare, are using the IoT to help hospitals with real-time location services to track staff, patients, and medical devices. Stanley Healthcare's IoT services can also provide environmental monitoring - for instance, checking the temperature of fridges where medication is stored.
<p>A challenge that must be faced by all healthcare professionals in relation to the IoT is how to manage the data that is collected from the devices. Collecting data without any meaningful strategy to utilize it is a wasted opportunity to improve patient care. For the IoT to be fit for purpose in modern healthcare, medical professionals must have a plan to transform data into meaningful insights.</p>
<blockquote> The Rise of Wearable Tracking Devices</blockquote>
It's reported that nearly a quarter of Americans own a wearable device. These devices can be used to track sleep, exercise, and heart rates. This aspect of modern healthcare sees consumers taking a proactive approach to their health by pairing up wearable devices with their smartphones to track and store data. Even though wearable technology is growing in popularity, there are some who believe that the adoption rate would be higher if doctors could use the information from the device to improve patient outcomes
<img src="images/heal3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
<blockquote>Evolving Healthcare</blockquote>
<p>Wearable devices could have a significant impact on improving patient's health. The effects on modern healthcare in relation to wearable technology are not yet fully understood. There are currently numerous studies to determine how wearables can positively affect health outcomes, for instance, The Orthopaedic Institute at the Geisinger Health System will partner with Universal Research Solutions to conduct a study to capture data from patients in real time. One of the aims of this study is to determine how data from wearable devices could assist health professionals to make better decisions.</p>

                              <h3>Modern Healthcare Today</h3>
                              <p>Modern healthcare has been transformed by advances in technology. The rise of a consumerization culture where people can easily shop around for suitable services also has an impact on modern healthcare. Medical practice managers need to respond to these changes by developing strategies to provide the best patient care while remaining profitable.

For decades, technology has been used in medicine to operate specialist machinery, like MRI scanners and x-ray machines. Increasingly, technology is being used to provide a better patient experience and run a more efficient practice. Modern healthcare requires the adoption of new ways of working and liaising with patients alongside providing expected standards of care.
Here are common features of modern healthcare and how your practice can implement strategies to rise to the challenges and seize opportunities:
<ul>
    <li>Improved doctor-patient communication</li>

    <li>Efficient recording of information in real-time</li>

    <li>More collaboration</li>

    <li>Better connectivity with Internet of Things (IoT)</li>

    <li>The rise of wearable tracking devices</li> </ul>
</p>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/ho7.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>
                              <blockquote>Improved doctor-patient communication</blockquote>
                              <p>Improving patient satisfaction scores should be a top priority for medical practices. The drive towards patient-centered care is a key facet of modern healthcare and doctors need to find new ways of effectively communicating with their patients. Patient engagement should extend beyond the conventional office visits. Health practitioners can learn from other industries, like retail, and consider using apps like chatbots to communicate with patients about run-of-the-mill inquiries. These chatbots can be developed and monitored by healthcare professionals. Facilitating this type of communication can be in the form of an online triage system to point patients in the right direction. </p>

<p>If the use of chatbots to communicate with patients is too advanced for your practice, consider using a form of electronic communication that the majority of your patients will have access to. A study from the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that, when email was used to communicate with patients, both doctors and patients experienced a higher level of satisfaction. To ensure patient confidentiality, consider using a HIPAA-compliant portal and messaging system, like Spok, for easier communication between you and your patient. Communication portals can also be used as self-service tools where patients can access test results, treatment plans, and information about their medical condition. It's believed that offering this level of convenience will provide:
<ul>
    <li>Greater continuity of care.</li>

    <li>Higher patient satisfaction.</li>

    <li>An increased patient retention rate.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/ho12.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>

                              <blockquote>Efficient recording of information in real-time</blockquote>
<p>Modern healthcare is driven by data. However, this data will only be fit for purpose if it's accurate and delivered on time. Errors when recording symptoms have led to misdiagnosis and the wrong treatment being administered. The traditional way of recording information involved doctors writing information on paper charts. These charts would need to be circulated to the different doctors dealing with the patient's care. Moving paper around increased the likelihood that charts would be misplaced.
Modern healthcare has improved the information recording process. Results and patient information is entered into a system that can be accessed by different healthcare professionals. Additionally, mobile devices are used to update the conversations with patients in real-time. This provides more accurate reporting since secretaries are no longer required to transcribe notes, which could lead to errors.</p>

<blockquote>More collaboration</blockquote>
<p>There has been a trend involving healthcare companies and companies outside of healthcare forming collaborations to deliver a more comprehensive service to patients. For example, the recent announcement that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan have joined forces to form an independent healthcare company.</p> These three industry giants are following in the footsteps of other companies that recognize the power of joining forces. The following companies have also entered into partnerships:
<p>
<ul>

    <li>Trinity Health System formed a joint venture with Heritage Provider Network to provide population health management services.</li>

    <li>Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin entered into an agreement with Aurora Health Care to invest in primary care and benefit from shared savings.</li>

    <li>Allina Health created Community Health Action Teams (CHATs) to collaborate on the design, implementation, and analysis of health promotion projects.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/ho11.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>
Collaboration in modern healthcare should not only be reserved for big companies. Regardless of the size of your medical practice, a collaborative approach with other healthcare professionals will be of benefit. Here are some advantages of forming meaningful partnerships:
<p><ul>

    <li>Comprehensive patient care - Patients have more options in relation to their care when partnerships are formed. You would be in a position to readily recommend your partner's services to provide a complete care package to your patient.</li>

    <li>Team cohesion - Your team members are less likely to feel isolated when in a partnership with other healthcare providers. With news about Amazon and the other two major companies joining forces, your staff could feel a sense of isolation working in a small practice. Partnering with suitable companies will remind them that your practice isn't on its own, but part of a group that has more bargaining power.</li></ul></p>

<blockquote>Better connectivity with Internet of Things (IoT)</blockquote>
<p>The IoT is when physical devices (known as connected or 'smart' devices) are embedded with software, sensors, and electronics to collect and exchange data. With the IoT healthcare market forecast to reach $136.8 billion globally be 2021, the IoT is becoming an increasing fixture in modern healthcare. The growth of the IoT is attributed to the following:
<ul>

    <li>An increase in the number of wearable devices.</li>

  <li>Higher rates of chronic diseases.</li>

    <li>Better access to high-speed internet.</li>


    <li>Expectations of cheaper treatment and disease management.</li></ul></p>
<blockquote>Evolving healthcare</blockquote>
<p>The face of modern healthcare continues to evolve. Position your practice to change with the times by taking advantage of the latest tools to increase patient satisfaction and help you to provide the best care. With some research, you can identify solutions that will suit your practice's budget and needs. For example, some EHR software is completely free of charge. Modern healthcare is characterized by increasingly savvy patients who will research and question the advice given to them. As patients use technology to assist them in their health challenges, they also expect medical practitioners to also utilize technology to provide them with the highest level of care.</p>

                              <h3>About Amazing Technology</h3>
                              <p>In just a few months time, the COVID-19 crisis has brought about years of change in the way companies in all sectors and regions do business. According to a new McKinsey Global Survey of executives, 1 their companies have accelerated the digitization of their customer and supply-chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years. And the share of digital or digitally enabled products in their portfolios has accelerated by a shocking seven years. 2 Nearly all respondents say that their companies have stood up at least temporary solutions to meet many of the new demands on them, and much more quickly than they had thought possible before the crisis. What's more, respondents expect most of these changes to be long lasting and are already making the kinds of investments that all but ensure they will stick. In fact, when we asked executives about the impact of the crisis on a range of measures, they say that funding for digital initiatives has increased more than anything else, more than increases in costs, the number of people in technology roles, and the number of customers.</p>

                                   <img src="images/tech2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>
                              <blockquote>Digital adoption has taken a quantum leap at both the organizational and industry levels</blockquote>
                              <p>During the pandemic, consumers have moved dramatically toward online channels, and companies and industries have responded in turn. The survey results confirm the rapid shift toward interacting with customers through digital channels. They also show that rates of adoption are years ahead of where they were when previous surveys were conducted and even more in developed Asia than in other regions. Respondents are three times likelier now than before the crisis to say that at least 80 percent of their customer interactions are digital in nature.</p>
                              
                              <ul>
                                   <li>Perhaps more surprising is the speedup in creating digital or digitally enhanced offerings. Across regions, the results suggest a seven-year increase, on average, in the rate at which companies are developing these products and services.</li>
                                   <li>Across sectors, the results suggest that rates for developing digital products during the pandemic differ. Given the time frames for making manufacturing changes, the differences, not surprisingly, are more apparent between sectors with and without physical products than between B2B and B2C companies.</li>
                                   <li>After these two challenges, B2B executives most often cite organizational and technology issues: the required changes represented too big a shock to established ways of working, IT infrastructure was insufficient, or organizational silos impeded commitment to and execution of the required changes.</li>
                              </ul>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/tech1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>

                              <blockquote>The largest changes are also the most likely to stick in the long term</blockquote>
<p>Of the 12 changes the survey asked about, respondents across sectors and geographies are most likely to report a significant increase in remote working, changing customer needs (a switch to offerings that reflect new health and hygiene sensitivities), and customer preferences for remote interactions (Exhibit 4). Respondents reporting significant changes in these areas and increasing migration to the cloud are more than twice as likely to believe that these shifts will remain after the crisis than to expect a return to precrisis norms. 
<blockquote>The results also suggest that companies are making these crisis-related changes with the long term in mind</blockquote>
For most, the need to work and interact with customers remotely required investments in data security and an accelerated migration to the cloud. Now that the investments have been made, these companies have permanently removed some of the precrisis bottlenecks to virtual interactions. Majorities of respondents expect that such technology-related changes, along with remote work and customer interactions, will continue in the future. Nearly one-quarter of respondents also report a decrease in their physical footprints. This signifies a longer-term shift than would likely occur among the 21 percent reporting a drop in their number of full-time equivalents at some companies, that could represent a temporary move in the earlier days of the crisis. What's more, when we asked about the effects of the crisis on a range of company measures (including head counts), respondents say that funding of digital initiatives has increased more than anything else, more than costs, the number of people in digital or other technology roles, and the number of customers.
<blockquote>Technology-driven strategy for the win</blockquote>
The COVID-19 crisis has made this imperative more urgent than ever. While the alignment on overall strategy and strong leadership have long been markers of success during disruptions or transformations, the extent of technology's differentiating role in this crisis is stark (Exhibit 5). At the organizations that experimented with new digital technologies during the crisis, and among those that invested more capital expenditures in digital technology than their peers did, executives are twice as likely to report outsize revenue growth than executives at other companies.

<blockquote>Executive mindsets on technology's strategic importance have changed radically during the crisis</blockquote>
Those reporting the biggest revenue hits in recent years acknowledge that they were behind their peers in their use of digital technologies, 40 percent say so, compared with 24 percent at companies with the biggest revenue increases and also say that, during the crisis, they have made much more significant changes to their strategies than other executives report.
<blockquote> Themindset shifts on digital are even more apparent at companiees with declining revenues</blockquote>
What's more, respondents say that technology capabilities stand out as key factors of success during the crisis. Among the biggest differences between the successful companies and all others is talent, the use of cutting-edge technologies, and a range of other capabilities. A related imperative for success is having a culture that encourages experimentation and acting early. Nearly half of respondents at successful companies say they were first to market with innovations during the crisis and that they were the first companies in their industries to experiment with new digital technologies. They are also more likely than others to report speeding up the time it takes for leaders to receive critical business information and reallocating resources to fund new initiatives. Both are key aspects of a culture of experimentation.
<blockquote>During the crisis, the most successful organizations report a range of technology-related capabilities that others lack</blockquote>
The notion of a tipping point for technology adoption or digital disruption isn't new, but the survey data suggest that the COVID-19 crisis is a tipping point of historic proportions and that more changes will be required as the economic and human situation evolves. The results also show that some significant lessons can be drawn from the steps organizations have already taken. One is the importance of learning, both tactically, in the process of making specific changes to businesses (which technologies to execute, and how), and organizationally (how to manage change at a pace that far exceeds that of prior experiences). Both types of learning will be critical going forward, since the pace of change is not likely to slow down.</p>

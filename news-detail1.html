                              <h3>About Amazing Technology</h3>
                              <p>In a matter of months, the COVID-19 crisis has driven years' worth of transformation across industries worldwide. A McKinsey Global Survey reveals that companies have accelerated the digitization of customer interactions, supply chains, and internal operations by three to four years. Digital or digitally enabled products have seen an unprecedented boost, advancing by seven years in portfolio integration. Nearly all surveyed executives reported implementing temporary solutions to adapt quickly to new demands, with many changes expected to become permanent. Investments in digital initiatives have surged, surpassing increases in operational costs, technology roles, and customer growth, ensuring these advancements are here to stay.</p>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/tech2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>
                              <blockquote>Digital adoption has surged dramatically across both organizational and industry levels, marking a significant leap forward in transformation.</blockquote>
                              <p>The pandemic has driven a significant shift toward online channels, with consumers embracing digital interactions and companies responding swiftly. Survey results reveal a rapid acceleration in digital engagement, with adoption rates now years ahead of prior trends, particularly in developed Asia. Respondents are three times more likely than before the crisis to report that at least 80% of customer interactions are now digital.</p>
                              
                              <ul>
                                   <li>Even more surprising is the rapid acceleration in the creation of digital or digitally enhanced offerings. The survey reveals an average seven-year jump across regions in the speed at which companies are developing these products and services.</li>
                                   <li>The survey results show that the pace of developing digital products during the pandemic varies across sectors. Due to the time required to implement manufacturing changes, these differences are more noticeable between sectors with physical products and those without, rather than between B2B and B2C companies.</li>
                                   <li>Following these two challenges, B2B executives most frequently point to organizational and technological obstacles. They highlight that the necessary changes were a significant disruption to established workflows, IT infrastructure proved inadequate, and internal silos hindered both the commitment and effective execution of the required adjustments.</li>
                              </ul>
<div class="news-image">
                                   <img src="images/tech1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                              </div>

                              <blockquote>The most significant changes are also the ones most likely to endure in the long run.</blockquote>
<p>Among the 12 changes surveyed, respondents from various sectors and regions are most likely to report a substantial increase in remote working, evolving customer needs—such as shifts toward offerings that address new health and hygiene concerns—and a growing preference for remote interactions (Exhibit 4). Those who have experienced significant changes in these areas, along with a rising shift to cloud migration, are more than twice as likely to believe these changes will endure beyond the crisis, compared to those expecting a return to pre-crisis norms. 
<blockquote>The results indicate that companies are implementing crisis-related changes with long-term sustainability in focus.</blockquote>
Most companies have invested in data security and accelerated cloud migration to support remote work and customer interactions. These changes have permanently removed pre-crisis bottlenecks to virtual engagement. Majorities expect these technology shifts, along with remote work and digital interactions, to continue long-term. Nearly one-quarter of respondents also report reducing their physical footprint, signaling a sustained shift. In contrast, only 21% see a temporary drop in full-time equivalents during the early crisis phase. Additionally, funding for digital initiatives has risen more than other measures, surpassing costs, staffing in digital roles, and customer numbers.
<blockquote>Technology-driven strategy for the win</blockquote>
The COVID-19 crisis has made this need more urgent than ever. While strong leadership and strategy have always been key during disruptions, the critical role of technology in this crisis is clear (Exhibit 5). Organizations that experimented with new digital tools and invested more in digital technology than peers are twice as likely to report significant revenue growth compared to others.

<blockquote>Executive perspectives on the strategic importance of technology have shifted dramatically during the crisis.</blockquote>
Executives facing the largest revenue declines in recent years acknowledge lagging behind peers in digital adoption—40% say this, compared to 24% at companies seeing revenue growth. These executives also report making far more substantial changes to their strategies during the crisis than others.
<blockquote>Themindset shifts on digital are even more apparent at companiees with declining revenues</blockquote>
Respondents highlight that technology capabilities have been key to success during the crisis. Successful companies stand out for their talent, use of cutting-edge technologies, and other capabilities. A crucial factor has been fostering a culture that encourages experimentation and taking early action. Nearly half of successful companies say they were first to market with innovations during the crisis and the first in their industries to experiment with new digital technologies. They’re also more likely to report speeding up critical business information flow and reallocating resources for new initiatives—key components of an experimental culture.
<blockquote>During the crisis, the most successful organizations report a range of technology-related capabilities that others lack</blockquote>
The concept of a tipping point for technology adoption isn’t new, but survey data suggest that the COVID-19 crisis represents a tipping point of historic magnitude, with more changes needed as the economy and human situation evolve. The results highlight key lessons from organizations' actions: the importance of tactical learning in making specific business changes (choosing and implementing technologies) and organizational learning in managing rapid change beyond previous experiences. Both forms of learning will be crucial, as the pace of change shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
